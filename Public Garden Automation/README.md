# Public Garden Automation System

## Overview
This project automates irrigation and lighting in a public garden using sensor-based control logic.

## System Features
- Automatic watering based on soil moisture level
- Automatic lighting based on ambient light conditions
- Reduces water and energy wastage

## Sensors & Components
- Soil moisture sensor
- LDR (light sensor)
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Motor driver
- Water pump
- Lighting system

## Software
- Platform: Arduino IDE (Pico core)
- Language: Embedded C / C++

## Code
- `garden_automation.ino` – Sensor-based control logic

## Application
Suitable for gardens, parks, and basic smart landscaping systems.

## Note
Code provided is a sample code not a the complete code

## Limitations
- Sensor readings may vary over time
- Fixed thresholds may not suit all plants
- Does not consider weather conditions like rain
- No remote monitoring or alerts
