# Inventory Control Robot

## Overview
The Inventory Control Robot is designed to assist with inventory tracking and basic warehouse automation. It automates item detection and movement to reduce manual effort.

## Objectives
- Automate inventory counting
- Reduce human error
- Improve warehouse efficiency

## Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Camera module
- Motor driver shield
- DC motors
- Bluetooth module (HC-05)

## Working Process
- Camera detects inventory items
- Microcontroller processes the data
- Inventory count is updated
- Data can be transmitted wirelessly

## Code
- Embedded control logic implemented using Arduino IDE

## Limitations
- Detection accuracy depends on lighting
- Limited processing capability
- Cannot distinguish similar-looking items reliably
- Suitable mainly for small-scale setups
