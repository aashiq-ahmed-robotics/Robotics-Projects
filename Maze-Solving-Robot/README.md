# Maze Solving Robot using Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements a maze-solving robot that uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path from a start point to a destination. The maze is represented as a graph structure.

## Concept
- Maze cells are treated as nodes
- Paths between cells are edges
- Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates the shortest path
- Robot follows the computed path

## Hardware Used
- Arduino UNO
- IR sensors
- Motor driver
- DC motors

## Software
- Arduino IDE
- C++
- Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Basic PID control for smooth movement

## Code
- `maze_solver.ino` – path planning and logic implementation

## Limitations
- Maze structure must be predefined or mapped
- Sensor noise can affect accuracy
- Not suitable for dynamic or changing mazes
- Limited maze size due to memory constraints
  
## Note
Code Provided is a sample code not a complete code
